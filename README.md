# cf-html
HTML version for CF website

## Basic Features

- Combines HTML5 Boilerplate files and Bootstrap’s HTML/CSS/JS.
- Comes with Bootstrap (v4) Sass source files and additional .scss files. Nicely sorted and ready to add your own variables and customize the Bootstrap variables.
- Uses a single and minified CSS file for all the basic stuff.
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) integration (v4.6.3)

## Confused by All the CSS and Sass Files?

Some basics about the Sass and CSS files that come with UnderStrap:
- The theme itself uses the `/style.css`file just to identify the theme inside of WordPress. The file is not loaded by the theme and does not include any styles.
- The `/css/theme.css` and it´s minified little brother `/css/theme.min.css` file(s) provides all styles. It is composed of five different SCSS sets and one variable file at `/sass/theme.scss`:

                  - 1 "theme/theme_variables";  // <--------- Add your variables into this file. Also add variables to overwrite Bootstrap or UnderStrap variables here
                  - 2 "../src/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap";  // <--------- All the Bootstrap stuff - Don´t edit this!
                  - 3 "../src/fontawesome/scss/font-awesome"; // <--------- Font Awesome Icon styles

                  // Any additional imported files //
                  - 4 "theme/theme";  // <--------- Add your styles into this file

- Your design goes into: `/sass/theme`. Add your styles to the `/sass/theme/_theme.scss` file and your variables to the `/sass/theme/_theme_variables.scss`. Or add other .scss files into it and `@import` it into `/sass/theme/_theme.scss`.
